	        <div>내용=Jay and Stephanie's cabin was a welcome escape from the day-to-day. It is a peaceful and relaxing getaway that is close to Joshua Tree National Park. Stargazing under the clear and open sky was incredible. We also enjoyed the fresh juices that were recommended to us. Thanks for a great stay!</div>

	        <div>내용=Jay and Stephanie's cabin is a sanctuary in the desert. Jay met me for check in and gave me the lay of the land. The cabin is just as advertised in the pictures. Exquisite. The outdoor shower is just perfect in the hot desert sun. I spent an evening painting at Joshua Tree park which is an amazing experience and a must see. I also did Angela's one day juice cleanse which was extraordinary and invigorating! I highly recommend this whole experience. I will be back!</div>

	        <div>내용=For my birthday, I took a long weekend at two of Stephanie and Jay's properties in the beautiful Mojave Desert -- two nights at the Homesteader Cabin and one night at the Homesteader Camp Cabin. Everything went smoothly. Communication was easy and the directions were clear. The properties themselves are really lovely -- beautifully restored with lots of thoughtful design details and artistic "grace notes." The natural setting is beautiful, and the dark night star-filled skies were a rare treat for this city dweller. I'll never forget my night under the stars in a hammock at the Homesteader Camp Cabin. On a practical note, I'm glad I left my low-riding sports car in Los Angeles and rented a mid-sized SUV for the trips. The properties are reached by dirt and sand road that can be quite bumpy.</div>
